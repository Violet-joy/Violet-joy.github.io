## Challenge: Trend Analysis of Incidence and Major Causes of Road Accidents in Kenya

**Problem Statement:**  
This lab challenge focused on analyzing road accident data in Kenya to identify trends in incident 
rates and uncover the major causes contributing to accidents over time.

**Approach:**  
I gathered and cleaned publicly available datasets from national transport and safety agencies. The analysis was carried out using Microsoft Excel and R. Visualizations were created to explore temporal trends, regional variations, and underlying causes. Excel functions supported calculations and filtering, while R provided more advanced visualizations.

**Tools & Technologies Used:**  
- Microsoft Excel  
- R (ggplot2, dplyr)

**Key Lessons Learned:**  
- Cleaned and transformed raw datasets for effective analysis  
- Gained experience with time-series and categorical data visualization  
- Learned to derive actionable insights to support data-driven policymaking
